Beamline voltage optimizer  —  STUDENT VERSION (you fill in the blanks)
======================================================================

This beamline is a small stack of metal electrodes that takes a beam of ions
(here: 500 singly-charged silicon ions, Si+ (mass 28 amu), at 15 eV) and tries
to steer and focus them all the way onto a Detector at the far end.

Each electrode can be set to a different *voltage*. Some are held fixed (the
source and detector, and the grounded parts), and the rest are free to choose.
There are too many combinations to try by hand, so we let the computer search:

    1. Optuna (an optimization library) PICKS a voltage for each free electrode.
    2. SIMION (ion-optics software) FLIES the 500 ions with those voltages.
    3. We SCORE the result: how many ions made it onto the Detector?
    4. Optuna learns from the score and picks better voltages next time.

================================  YOUR TASKS  ================================
Most of this program is written for you (reading SIMION's output, scoring the
result, checking the setup, all the configuration). TWO pieces are left for YOU,
marked with `TODO` and a `raise NotImplementedError(...)` that stops the program
until you finish them:

    TASK 1 -- the SIMION commands. Make Python tell SIMION what to do:
              (1a) the "fly" command string  ->  FLY_COMMAND
              (1b) the "fastadj" command      ->  apply_voltages()

    TASK 2 -- the Optuna loop. Drive the optimization:
              (2a) the objective() function
              (2b) building the study and running it, in main()

Search this file for "TODO" to jump to each one. A short SIMION command
reference is included just above Task 1; the full manual is the included
simion8manual.pdf (Appendix M, Command Line Interface), or simion.chm (see the
note there). Implement them in order (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b) and test as you go.

How positions are read (already done for you)
---------------------------------------------
SIMION prints lines like "xyz(12, 75, 77)mm" for each ion that reaches the
Detector; get_positions() below turns those into numbers.

What you need to run this
-------------------------
    * Python packages:   pip install optuna numpy
    * SIMION 8.1 installed, and the geometry already refined (Step 0).

Run it from a terminal with:   python optimizer.py

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  You drive SIMION by running its command-line program. The sub-commands:
#
#    refine   solve the field from the geometry .PA#  ->  makes .PA0 + arrays.
#             You already ran this once in Step 0; the optimizer never calls it.
#
#    fastadj  set electrode voltages on the fast-adjust .PA0 array. Form:
#               simion --nogui fastadj "<PA0 file>" 1=500,3=120.5,19=-2000
#             (the voltages are a comma-separated list of  number=volts  pairs)
#
#    fly      fly the ions in the .iob through the field and print where they
#             land. Form:
#               simion --nogui fly --recording-output=out.txt --programs=0
#                      --retain-trajectories=0 --restore-potential=0 "<iob file>"
#
#  Flags:  --nogui (no window, required for scripting),
#          --recording-output=FILE (data file),
#          --retain-trajectories=0 (don't store full ion paths -> faster),
#          --restore-potential=0 (keep the voltages you just set),
#          --programs=0 (lean batch run).
#
#  MANUAL:  easiest is the included  simion8manual.pdf : everything is in
#    Appendix M (Command Line Interface); the commands are the same in that
#    older version. The newer manual is  simion.chm  in your SIMION folder
#    (next to simion.exe); search "command line". NOTE: .chm is a Windows Help
#    file and Windows OFTEN BLOCKS it (via Smart App Control, or the file's
#    "Mark of the Web"). If it opens blank or says "navigation cancelled",
#    right-click the file -> Properties -> tick "Unblock" -> OK. If Smart App
#    Control still blocks it, copy simion.chm to a local folder and open there.
